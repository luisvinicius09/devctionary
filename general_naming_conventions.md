# Naming Convention

> Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention#:~:text=A%20naming%20convention%20is%20a,the%20names%20based%20on%20regularities.

The choice of naming conventions (and the extent to which they are enforced) is often a contentious issue, with partisans holding their viewpoint to be the best and other to be inferior. Moreover, even with known and well-defined naming conventions in place, some organizations may fail to consistently adhere to them, causing inconsistency and confusion. These challenges may be exacerbated if the naming convetion rules are internally inconsisten, arbitrary, difficult to remembem, or otherwise perceived as more burdensome than beneficial.

Well chosen identifiers make it sifnificantly easier for developers and analysts to understand what the system is doing and how to fix or extend the source code to apply for new needs.

Ex:
```js
a = b * c

// can be better written like

weeklyPay = hoursWorked * hourlyPayRate;
```
Implying the intent and meaning of the source code, at least to those familiar with the context of the statement.
